<p>Most homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
