<p>Hidden water leaks are typically difficult and have Possibly Serious Consequences. Replacing your flapper may require slightly different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>An authorized backflow prevention assembly must be set up on each drinkable water service connection to any properties including particular types of centers.

The minimum accepted backflow prevention assembly for unlisted facilities will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
