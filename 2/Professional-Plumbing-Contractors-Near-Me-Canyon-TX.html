<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
