<p>Toilets can be challenging and picky sometimes, depending on what parts have actually stopped working and the specific situation of your installation.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
