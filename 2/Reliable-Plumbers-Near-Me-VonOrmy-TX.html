<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and replaced with new rubber parts. It is necessary that only original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be checked periodically to ensure they are working effectively. A visual check of air spaces suffices, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be checked with properly adjusted gauge devices.</p>

Gas tank units utilize practically 50% less energy, costing less to run, than the electric variety. Nevertheless, they cost a bit more than electrical designs.

We provide gas water heater service, as well as electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
