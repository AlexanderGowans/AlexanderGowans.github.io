<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Hudson NH</h3>
<p>Anti-Scale Devices: Some water heaters promote functions that decrease mineral scale buildup by churning water in the bottom of the tank. Functions such as these add cost, and aren't that reliable. Your best method is to get the hot water heater with the 12 year service warranty. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping products cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot.

But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall.
