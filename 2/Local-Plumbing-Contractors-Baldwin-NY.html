<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Photo 1. Water is most likely escaping through a cracked or worn away overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise.

<p>When choosing the proper system defense there are several considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on an individual basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the risk that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to satisfy that particular danger or need. An airplane hangar will need an extremely various fire protection system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
