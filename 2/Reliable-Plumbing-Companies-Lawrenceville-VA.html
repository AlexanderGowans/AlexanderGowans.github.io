Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water in fact needs it. When needed, more recent units use digital sensing units that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore only regenerate. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>
