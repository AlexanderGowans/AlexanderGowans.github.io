<p>Day to day usage ought to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a steady and safe area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings.
