<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has area to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the hardness minerals have a greater positive charge than the salt, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>When deciding on the appropriate system protection there are a number of considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be taken a look at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be really different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to meet that particular hazard or need. An airplane garage will need a very different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
