<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most prevalent and devastating water problems: difficult water.  Hard water ruined the modern-day home. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale considerably reduces the lifespan of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices. Tough water destroys hot water appliances. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
