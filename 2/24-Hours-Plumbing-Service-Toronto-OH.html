<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a temporary fix. It's a permanent solution for the whole plumbing system in your house or organisation.
