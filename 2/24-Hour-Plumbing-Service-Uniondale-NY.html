<p>The program accomplishes its objective by attending to the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and regulations for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. Physical Damage: Fractures and dents to the physical hot water heater or water tank require aid from qualified water heater contractors.

If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
