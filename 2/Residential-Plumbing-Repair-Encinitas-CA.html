<p>While gas leaks are not as common as other plumbing problems they still happen. Leaks caused by deterioration, improper installation or by digging do take place, and when it does, you need a gas line repair expert to take care of the issue.

<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water circulation in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>

Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century.
