<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Vidalia GA</h3>

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were extremely responsive and timely to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were extremely professional and did a remarkable task.

Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes.
