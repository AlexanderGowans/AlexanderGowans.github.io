<p>Everybody who's set up a couple of disposals is aware of this mistake: Forgetting to eliminate the dishwasher knockout before hanging the system. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently utilized and you've changed the flapper, the problem may be larger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its ability to seal correctly, developing waste and a greater water costs.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
