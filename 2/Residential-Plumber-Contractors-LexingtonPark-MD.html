<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is also acts as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Inspector for the group. There are few instances when plumbing inspections are necessary, however the biggest exceptions are building and house updates. If you choose to take on a bathroom remodel (for instance), you'll need to set up at least 2 evaluations, including a rough-in inspection of the new piping and a last checkup before linking your devices.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally salt. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
