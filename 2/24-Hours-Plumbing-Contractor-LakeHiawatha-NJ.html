If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based).
