Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the splendor in the toilet world, however the trip lever is the bridge in between man and machine.

And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity however, making certain your trip lever is working well can conserve you the inconvenience of those little everyday hassles - that most people just live with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water wasted every day by a bad seal.</p>
