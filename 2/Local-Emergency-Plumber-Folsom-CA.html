For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can break up the obstruction and send it down the pipes. We suggest you opt for drain snaking instead of utilizing strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners may do more damage than great by rusting your pipes.</p>
