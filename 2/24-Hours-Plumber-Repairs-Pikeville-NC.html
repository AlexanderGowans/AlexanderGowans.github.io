<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself at Pikeville NC</h3>
<p>The law also needs yearly testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can lead to penalties and termination of water service. Because backflow preventer devices are made up of moving springs, seals, and parts and undergo destructive compounds, wear, and fatigue, it's important to properly preserve them to ensure they appropriately operate and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
