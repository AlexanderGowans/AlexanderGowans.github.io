<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and destructive water problems: hard water.  Hard water wreaks havoc on the contemporary house. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale drastically reduces the lifespan of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices. Tough water ruins warm water home appliances. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
