<p>So what should you do as a property owner? First off, do not try to tackle the job of repairing the sink yourself.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
