<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is important to identify the exact location of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
