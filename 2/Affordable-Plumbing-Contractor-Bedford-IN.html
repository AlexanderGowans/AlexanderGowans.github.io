The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
