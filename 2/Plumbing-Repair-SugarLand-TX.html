<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, consisting of bad soil conditions, obstructions from grease and gunk, and rust. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, specifically in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as intensified if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative provides better, much safer drinking water. When showering in conditioned or softened water you will enjoy healthier skin and hair. Sewer lines that need to be changed or repaired due to clogs, tree roots, or other problems are frequently accompanied by a variety of concerns such as bad odors, water backing up and bubbles coming through your drain.</p>
