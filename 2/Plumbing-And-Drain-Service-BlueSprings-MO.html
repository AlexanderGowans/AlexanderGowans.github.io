<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
