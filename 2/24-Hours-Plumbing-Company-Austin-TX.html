<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your home.

<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
