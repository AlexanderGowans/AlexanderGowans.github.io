The reasons for this can range from leakages, faulty or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating element or thermostat.

<p>In community supply of water systems, water is usually maintained at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might occur when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation occurs, contaminated water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique used. The best and most safe type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The correct backflow prevention device is needed if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
