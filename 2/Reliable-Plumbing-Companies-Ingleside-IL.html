<p>By replacing the rusted and rusted galvanized metal pipe with brand-new copper pipes, your home will have cleaner and better-tasting water.

<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
