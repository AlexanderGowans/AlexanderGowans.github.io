<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the concern. You may need to look into using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. There are 2 basic piping products utilized by plumbing professionals. PEX and copper both provide various benefits and advantages such as eliminating the metal taste from your water.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
