When figuring out the hardness of water, there are series of grains per gallon (gpg).

<p>There are lots of problems in your houses plumbing that can trigger the need for repair services. Mineral accumulation can trigger constraints on the water supply lines which can impact the water pressure entering our houses. Old and worn pipe joints can easily corrode and end up being weak in time leaving them susceptible to breaking and splitting. Small leaks from old worn pipes can trigger water damage which promotes the development of mold and mildew which can posture a health danger to you and your household. While much of these issues can be avoided with regular maintenance, once your pipes have become damaged they need immediate repair services.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
