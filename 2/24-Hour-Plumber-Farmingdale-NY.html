<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for specific applications?

Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon prior to it can take place, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers.
