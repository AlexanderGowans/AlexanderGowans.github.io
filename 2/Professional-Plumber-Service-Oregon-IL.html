<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, since I never ever want to see this company once again.</p>
