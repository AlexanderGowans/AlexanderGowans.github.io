<p>To lower the need of gas line repair, it is very important to comprehend the common causes of gas leaks. Indoor gas leakages from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices occur most commonly in the winter. This is since homes are not properly aerated during the cooler months to avoid heat loss. We recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to inform you of any potential gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>

This can be difficult, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed.
