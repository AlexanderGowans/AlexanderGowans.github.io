However using PEX would cost just $4,000 to $6,000, according to Gove. Since of lower product and labor expenses, that's. If it takes you two days to re-plumb a house with copper, you can do that exact same home in a day with PEX," states Emanuel.</p>

We turn off the water supply, eliminate old pipe and replace it with brand-new pipe. After the new system is installed, we turn the water on and perform tests on the brand-new system. When the system passes our tests, it's good to opt for you.</p>
