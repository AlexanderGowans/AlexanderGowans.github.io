<p>Many homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
