<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
