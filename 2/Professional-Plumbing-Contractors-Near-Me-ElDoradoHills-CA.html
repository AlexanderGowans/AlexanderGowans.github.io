<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller model that ran on the very same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>

Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system assists guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also protect the resin bed, so we do not need to squander area on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that permit a churning of resin throughout regrowth to launch hardness, sediment and dirt.</p>
