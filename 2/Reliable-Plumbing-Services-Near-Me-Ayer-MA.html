<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
