<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
