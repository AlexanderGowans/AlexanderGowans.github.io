<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
