Extended guarantee: The majority of disposals feature at least a 1-year service warranty, but if you purchase one with a lifetime service warranty (15+ years), it will most likely be more costly.

<p>Sometimes you know you have a sewer line break since you can smell nasty odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is necessary to pinpoint the exact place of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can conserve you countless dollars in repairs. Just sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance city, real estate agent or company inspector.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
