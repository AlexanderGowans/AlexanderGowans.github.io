<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>If your pipes are close to or past their beneficial life, it's time to consider replacing them entirely. Pipe life-spans differ, however normally speaking, pipes 50 years or older need to be examined. Materials frequently used during the 1970s, such as galvanized steel, may have worn away by now.

I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel.
