<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your house can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is revealing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
