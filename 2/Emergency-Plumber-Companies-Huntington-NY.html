<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high threat of coming into contact with pollutants due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout.

<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
