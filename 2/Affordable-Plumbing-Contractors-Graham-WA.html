<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and industrial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in families and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, along with improving current reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is simpler and more economical than other softening systems on the marketplace today that use zeolites, which should be restored using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that needs significant water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer will be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on wet or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's an irreversible solution for the entire plumbing system in your home or company. We shut off the supply of water, remove old pipe and replace it with brand-new pipe. After the new system is set up, we turn the water on and perform tests on the new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's great to go for you.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report must be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad smell and taste. It gets rid of the mineral material to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great when you include a water softener.</p>
