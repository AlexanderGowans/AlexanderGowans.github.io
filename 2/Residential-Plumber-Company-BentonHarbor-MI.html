<p>If there is backflow at your home, you could contaminate your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.

<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
