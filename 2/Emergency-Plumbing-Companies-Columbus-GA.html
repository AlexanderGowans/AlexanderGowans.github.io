In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future.
