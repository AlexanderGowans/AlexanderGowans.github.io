A water heater is a costly plumbing home appliance, and we tend to press off changing it until it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing equipment that we ignore up until we wake up to a cold shower. We may hear the water heater making noise, attempting to tell us there is a problem, but we ignore it which may result in a more substantial repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It is essential to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you react to a concern, the better opportunity you'll need to save time and money on water heater services.</p>
