<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unneeded blockages even more down the water lines. In some instances, resins can not be washed of pollutants and will need to be changed. (This should not hold true if the resin is regularly restored and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealership for info on resin replacement.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace.
