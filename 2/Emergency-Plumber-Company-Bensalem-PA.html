<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace.

The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures.
