<p>The next step we must perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed.
