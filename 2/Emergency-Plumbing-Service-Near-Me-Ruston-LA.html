Water pressure may be or stop working minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
