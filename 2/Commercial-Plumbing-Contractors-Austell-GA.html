<p>Water firmness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often described as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they need to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>

From a toilet repair or sink repair to complicated plumbing jobs like a re-pipe or bathroom remodel, there is no task that we can't handle.</p>
