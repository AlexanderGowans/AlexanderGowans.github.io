<p>The area under your kitchen sink has actually gotten more crowded throughout the years. Originally, there would have been a hot and cold  water line increasing to the faucet (usually with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Utilizing liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless service technicians can cure in-place entire new areas of pipe within your damaged line, by means of small and even pre-existing entry points.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and undamaged, without any signs of leakage, you can most likely leave it in place. Possibilities are great that the mounting brackets on the brand-new unit will fit just fine. To find out, remove the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>
