Worms for watering systems: Citizens found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground lawn sprinkler.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
