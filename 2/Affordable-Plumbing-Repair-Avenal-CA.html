Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot. A popular replacement material for metal pipes, CPVC pipe is rigid plastic piping that has thick walls and can be used for cold and hot drinking water pipes. CPVC is simple to install and satisfies the most rigorous building regulations.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>
