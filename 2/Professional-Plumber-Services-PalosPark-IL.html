<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
