<p>As described earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide gas is entirely odor free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house ought to have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the correct locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups need to have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not wish to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Replace when you renovate. Whenever you remodel a part of your home, take the opportunity to examine-- and if need be, replace-- any plumbing lines that you expose when you open the floors and walls. This includes not only the plumbing in the kitchen or bathroom that you're remaking, but also any pipes going through the walls to feed upstairs bathrooms.</p>
