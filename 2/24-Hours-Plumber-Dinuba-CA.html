A license is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions supplied alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>
