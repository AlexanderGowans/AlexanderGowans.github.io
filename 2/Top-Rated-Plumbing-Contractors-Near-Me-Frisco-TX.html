<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A reaction crew is available for preliminary investigation of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance staff at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through sinks or toilets. City workers will inspect and remove obstructions in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is responsible for. If the problem is the outcome of excessive storm water in the system, you might have to wait till the storm has subsided to have the backup dealt with.</p>
