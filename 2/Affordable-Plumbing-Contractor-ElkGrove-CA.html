<p>While lots of water heater problems can be successfully fixed, some problems will demand total hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its typical lifespan (normally anywhere from 8 to 10 years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a significant leak or comprehensive rust, it might be time to consider replacement.</p>

If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
