<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around. Under the sink, place a container or pan underneath the waste pipe, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe.
