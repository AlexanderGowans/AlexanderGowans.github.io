<p>106.2.1 Repairing Leaks. The stopping of leaks in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe, provided that if any concealed trap, drain, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes malfunctioning and it ends up being essential to get rid of and replace the exact same with new material, such work will be considered as new work and a permit will be acquired and an inspection made as supplied in this Code, subject to the provisions stated in Area 106.2.2.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
