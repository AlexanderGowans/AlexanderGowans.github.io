Worms for irrigation systems: Locals found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler.

<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
