<p>As a company owner, you understand how vital a functional commercial plumbing system is for your business. When it comes to commercial sinks, they are an essential from a sanitation standpoint-- they permit you to wash meals, keep your establishment clean, and allow your staff members to wash their hands. Having a commercial sink with a clogged drain is not a choice. Call today and ask about Roto-Rooter's commercial sink repair options.</p>
<p>Does it appear like your drains are constantly slow or clogged? Typically, this is caused by built-up sediment and other products that are causing an obstruction in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will try to charge you a leg and an arm to collect and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station uses hydro jetting, an extremely reliable option for removing stubborn products that have stuck to the walls of your pipeline, restoring a healthy circulation to your drains.</p>
<p>If you  wish to get rid of the salt, merely fill the salt water tank with potassium chloride pellets, not salt pellets. The only issue is that potassium chloride is expensive: $25 to $30 per 50-pound bag. Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that utilizes high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. A lot of high-pressure water jetters will operate with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
