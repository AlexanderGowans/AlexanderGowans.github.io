For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of deterioration control. Therefore, considering all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
