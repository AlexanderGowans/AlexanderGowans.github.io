<p>As the camera is moved through your drain it supplies us with a live-feed of your pipe together with all imperfections like blockages, cracks, breaks, and obstructions.

<p>The typical life expectancy of an electric hot water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain path, little pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a bigger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home.</p>
<p>1. Sankarasubramanian, A., et al. Synthesis of Public Water Supply Usage in the United States: Spatio-Temporal Patterns and Socio-Economic Controls," Earth's Future, 5: 771-788, 2017. Weak or no flush: The inability to flush your toilet or having to flush several times after one use suggests it's time for a replacement. It will likely be cheaper to replace the toilet instead of repair it.</p>

<p>Improperly set up gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy task. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe ought to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not in fact glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, punctured or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is referred to as fouling. Sometimes it may be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to maker guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
