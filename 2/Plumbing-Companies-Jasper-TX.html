<p>Backflow preventers should only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
