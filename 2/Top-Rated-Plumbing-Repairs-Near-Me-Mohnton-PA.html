<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly.
