<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of corrosion control.
