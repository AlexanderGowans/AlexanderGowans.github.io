<p>The toilet takes an actually long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is designed to open and discharge water to the outside, guaranteeing backflow never ever takes place.</p>
<p>Backpressure may occur when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be required into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not effectively protected.</p>
