<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and devastating water problems: hard water.  Difficult water damaged the contemporary house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the lifespan of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice makers. Tough water damages warm water home appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
