<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange.

<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the hardness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it pertains to pipe repair, the most expensive aspects aren't the machinery or products utilized, however the uprooting, landscaping and yard damage that ensues.</p>
<p>This is the timeless concern that many homeowners ask themselves. Is it better to repair their pipes or repipe them and start fresh? The answer is completely based on your distinct circumstance. For example, if your pipe is experiencing a small leak but is in otherwise great condition, we would recommend repairing it. However, if the pipe is constantly leaking and requires regular repairs, we would advise repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never ever advise service or products that would not truly benefit the client.</p>
