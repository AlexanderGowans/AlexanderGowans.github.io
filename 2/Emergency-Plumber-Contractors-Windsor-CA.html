<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks at Windsor CA?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
