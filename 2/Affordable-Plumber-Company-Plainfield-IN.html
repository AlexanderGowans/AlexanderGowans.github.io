<p>Both methods are highly efficient and minimizing waste and clearing it. The greatest difference remains in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the system, cover it, then turn it on. If it's totally complete, it will take a bit to clear through the waste, and if you discover you forgot something, you need to wait until it's done to put the new waste in.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to have a professional evaluate your drain system if you experience obstructions and backups in your home more than a few times. A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to check your drain system.
