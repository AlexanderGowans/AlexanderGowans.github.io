<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not included a power cord attached. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to buy a circuitry set with the proper power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you link the wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord.</p>
