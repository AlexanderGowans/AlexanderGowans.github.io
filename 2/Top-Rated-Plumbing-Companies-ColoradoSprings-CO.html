Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
