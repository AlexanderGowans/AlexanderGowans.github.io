Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find among the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
