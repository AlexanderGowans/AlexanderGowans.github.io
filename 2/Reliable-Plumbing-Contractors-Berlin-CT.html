<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product. Some disposer units do not featured a power cable attached. If this is the case, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1).

Numerous new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - primarily with sinks. For the most part, a sink drain problem is brought on by extreme contaminants or particles inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care products or soaps.

Anytime you find a clogged drain, reach out to Resurrection Plumbing to identify the problem and suggest the ideal repairs.</p>

<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive choice.</p>
