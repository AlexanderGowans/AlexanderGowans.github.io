Water pressure might stop working or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
