<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air.

<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners sell these days. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin.
