Local plumber quoted rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around. Under the sink, place a pail or pan underneath the waste pipe, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
