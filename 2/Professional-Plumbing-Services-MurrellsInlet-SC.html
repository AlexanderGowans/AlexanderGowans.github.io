<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many elements that speed up rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these elements, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
