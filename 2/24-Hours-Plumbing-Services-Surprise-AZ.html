The City needs backflow prevention devices to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that could allow tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These gadgets are subject to testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they undergo routine tests later on, as well.</p>
