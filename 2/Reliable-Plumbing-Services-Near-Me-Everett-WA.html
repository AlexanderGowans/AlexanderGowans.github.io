The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

<p>A minimum of once every three months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining a gallon or so helps remove the sediment.

To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your whole home when you identify a leak.</p>
