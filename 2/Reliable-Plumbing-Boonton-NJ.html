<p>In some cases, our technicians will advise that you replace your water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is typically the case when the water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of an entire new unit. Often a bothersome toilet just needs a small modification and life is back to normal. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>

Before going into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to comprehend how a toilet works.  Many houses in the US, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades over time allowing water to leave into the toilet bowl, therefore reducing the amount of water in the tank offered for a flush.  It likewise has the downside of increasing your water bill due to wastage of water.</p>
<p>Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving. Registered contractors are required to record backflow test result through the Backflow Prevention Assembly Testing and Stock application within 15 days of test. Any reports sent through mail, email or fax will not be accepted. After examining these information, our professional will suggest the water heater design that best suits your needs and will discuss pricing and funding choices.</p>
