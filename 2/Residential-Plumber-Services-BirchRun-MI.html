<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
