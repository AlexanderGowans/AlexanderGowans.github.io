Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
