<p>There are 2 fundamental types of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by using 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Gravity-fed flush toilets utilize the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to clear the bowl. Look for gravity-fed toilets using high performance to effectively and silently get rid of waste. CIPP: Apollo utilizes this innovation to repair a damaged pipe.
