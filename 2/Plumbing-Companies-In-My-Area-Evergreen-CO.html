<h3>You Can Save Money With Water Leak Detection in Evergreen CO</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be constantly kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on wet or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
