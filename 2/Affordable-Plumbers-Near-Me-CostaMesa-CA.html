<p>In most cases, the toilet can be fixed rather than replaced, because the problem often boils down to a single component or more. In some cases, nevertheless, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is merely a more practical alternative. This usually includes fractures in the toilet bowl itself, prevalent rust over numerous parts, or simply since you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>When the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers should just be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if needed, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
