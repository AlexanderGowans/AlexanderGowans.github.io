<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
