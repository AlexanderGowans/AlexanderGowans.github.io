<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
