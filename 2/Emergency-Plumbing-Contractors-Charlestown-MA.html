For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of corrosion control. Thus, considering all these elements, along with arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
<p>Get rid of scratchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener. These models attach to or replace your existing shower head to stabilize the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals.
