Large quantities of food can rapidly overwhelm the system and cause a substantial clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives many phone calls requesting waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you could pollute your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.
