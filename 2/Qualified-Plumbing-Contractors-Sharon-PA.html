Put it by doing this, if you're a skilled convenient person, but you've never ever managed this specific repair, you can most likely do it, supplying you do your research. I would draw the line at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired hot water heater (and some other specialized models). Their installation must be handled by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
