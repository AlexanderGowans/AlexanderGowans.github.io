<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first acquire the needed permit( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page for more information on getting a license. As soon as you acquire a permit you can begin with the work. However, you should call for inspection prior to you cover or hide any work.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation might still happen.</p>
