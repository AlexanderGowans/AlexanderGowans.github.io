Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>
