<p>Two styles of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB might be used to isolate health or non-health dangers but works against back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>Backpressure may occur when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not appropriately secured.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear space will be maintained above the assembly to allow for servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves. As soon as you believe a problem with your sewer or water lines, call a plumber. A break or a blockage can lead to damages that are costly to repair so time is of the essence. Our professionally-trained, background-checked, and licensed plumbers will gladly respond to any concerns you have about your home's plumbing system.</p>
