<p>There are a couple of indications that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your house, and it is essential to pay attention to them. The gas pipe might be pierced or harmed if you observe a strong smell that resembles rotten eggs. You might also hear a hissing noise as the gas is getting away from the line, but that isn't constantly the case. It is crucial to take action rapidly to prevent any severe problems and to keep everyone safe if you smell rotten eggs.</p>

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
