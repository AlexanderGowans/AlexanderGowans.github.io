Toilets also have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.

However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
