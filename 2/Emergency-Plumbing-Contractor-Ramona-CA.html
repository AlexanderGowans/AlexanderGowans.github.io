A common protective device called a backflow preventer (BFP) can be set up within the plumbing system to effectively shut-off the house or organisation from the street sewer system throughout sewage back-ups.</p>
<p>Back-siphonage is backflow brought on by an unfavorable pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or consumer's potable water supply.
