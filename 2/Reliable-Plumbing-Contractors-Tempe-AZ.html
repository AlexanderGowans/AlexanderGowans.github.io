<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Tempe AZ</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
