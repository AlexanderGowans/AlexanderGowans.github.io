If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You ought to also examine to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
