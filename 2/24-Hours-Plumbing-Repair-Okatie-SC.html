<p>The system has actually returned to a no need condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This allows pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Reduced Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
<p>A check backflow preventer includes two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back siphonage and back pressure on non-health risk (low risk) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that connects the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Suggestion: Throw a towel on the floor below to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
