<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
