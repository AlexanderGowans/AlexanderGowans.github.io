<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 โฒ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
