<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
