I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
