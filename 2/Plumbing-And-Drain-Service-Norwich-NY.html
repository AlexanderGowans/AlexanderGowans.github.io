Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
