<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the infected water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, along with checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
