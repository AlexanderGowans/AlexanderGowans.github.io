<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
