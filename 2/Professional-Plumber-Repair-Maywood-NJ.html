Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would offer an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the circumstance prior to dedicating to a rate, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
