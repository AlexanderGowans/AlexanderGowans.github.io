For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of deterioration control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
