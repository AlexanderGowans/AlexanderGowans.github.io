<p>Backflow preventers must just be repaired when the data gathered from the field test shows the assembly has broken down in its efficiency listed below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if needed, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
