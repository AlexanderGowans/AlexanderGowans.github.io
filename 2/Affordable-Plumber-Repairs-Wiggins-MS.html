<p>If there is backflow at your home, you could infect your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.

<p>DCVs are particularly designed to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
