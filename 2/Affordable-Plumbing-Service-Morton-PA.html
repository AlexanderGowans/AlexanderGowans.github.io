<p>He dug 2 holes on either side of the pipe and had the ability to blast the old, damaged pipe out while changing it with a new one at the very same time. We did a follow-up call to the house owner several weeks later on, and she reported no excess water in her yard. Job well done: You do not wish to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a certified plumber makes sure a smooth installation procedure.</p>
