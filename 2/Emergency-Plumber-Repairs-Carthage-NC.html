<p>Fixing a leaky faucet seems like an easy task, however many times the scenario can be deceptively made complex. Often it's best to call in a certified plumber to make sure the origin of the leak is appropriately recognized and resolved the first time, instead of making several journeys to the hardware shop and purchasing a range of parts just to wind up precisely where you began, or even worse, creating an even larger mess.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
