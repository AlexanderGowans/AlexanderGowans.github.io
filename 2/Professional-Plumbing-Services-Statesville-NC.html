<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try in Statesville NC</h3>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
