<p>In community water supply systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your house or business. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario happens, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach utilized. The best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the appropriate backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
