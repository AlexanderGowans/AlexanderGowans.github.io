<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and really responsive to send me a bid which was very competitive. They were very professional and did an incredible task.

Now, if this staining only appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes.

<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
