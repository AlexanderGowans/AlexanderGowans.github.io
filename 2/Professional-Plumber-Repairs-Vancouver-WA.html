<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A permit is not required for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions offered modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Water conditioners do not efficiently remove firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
