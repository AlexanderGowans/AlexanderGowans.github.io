<p>Find the ideal water softener for you. If you are in a position that you see the signs of a gas line leak, the most crucial thing to do is to get out of your house as soon as possible.

Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
