<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to think about repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
