<p>In most cases, the toilet can be repaired instead of replaced, since the concern often comes down to a single part or two. In some cases, nevertheless, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is just a more practical alternative. This generally involves fractures in the toilet bowl itself, widespread corrosion over several parts, or just since you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
