Blanc also built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
