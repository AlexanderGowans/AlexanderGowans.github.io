<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
