<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health.
