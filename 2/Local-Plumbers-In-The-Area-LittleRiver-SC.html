<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however declared they would not take obligation if it leaked now since of some undefined quirks in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing.

<p>You live in an older house. There's an excellent opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
