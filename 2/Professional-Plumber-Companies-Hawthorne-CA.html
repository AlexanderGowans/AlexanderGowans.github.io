<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
