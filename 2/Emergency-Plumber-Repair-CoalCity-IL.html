<p>Never ever attempt a repair or waste disposal unit installation on your own. Constantly trust a professional to lower the possibilities of injury.

After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never wish to see this company again.</p>
