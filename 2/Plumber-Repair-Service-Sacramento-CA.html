<p>Backflow preventers are critical for developing a safe supply of water system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be correctly preserved. The salt water service should be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Regular clogging of the resin also needs special attention. For instance, if the raw water system is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, regular backwashing with water will fix this issue.
