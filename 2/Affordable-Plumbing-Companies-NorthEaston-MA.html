For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate corrosion Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
