<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>When the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has degraded in its efficiency below the established minimum basic, backflow preventers must just be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
