<p>Most homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>At least once every three months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon approximately helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the exact same material and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your whole house when you spot a leak.</p>
