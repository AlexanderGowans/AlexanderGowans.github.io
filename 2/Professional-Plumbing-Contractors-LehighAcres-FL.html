<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in LehighAcres FL?</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many desired usages around your home.</p>
