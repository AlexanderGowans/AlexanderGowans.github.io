<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
