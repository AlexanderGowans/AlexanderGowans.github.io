<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just removes firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require fewer repairs with time. Sanford & Son plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regrowth, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>

Under the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established national requirements for safe drinking water. Each state is required to impose the various policies of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it relates to its state laws.</p>
