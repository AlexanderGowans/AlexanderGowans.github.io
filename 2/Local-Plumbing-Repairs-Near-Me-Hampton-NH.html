As for the advantages of electrical storage tank hot water heater, they are safer and simpler to preserve compared to their gas equivalents.</p>

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
