<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of construction contractors (or their employees). Reattach the gas tank to the Weed Eater trimmer with the Torx screws that held it in location initially. Reattach the fuel lines to the carburetor in the exact same positions as they were originally put. Reconnect the spark plug wire. A gas line will initially need to be run from the street to the house, a meter set up, followed by gas lines installed inside the home from the meter to the new home appliances. Expenses can differ dramatically based on the intricacy of the install, and what size pipe and connections each appliance needs.</p>
