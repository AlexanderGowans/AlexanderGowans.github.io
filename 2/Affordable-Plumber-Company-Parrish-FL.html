<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are many aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate rust Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. Hence, considering all these elements, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
