Pinhole leaks, for example, are so small that they just launch a couple of droplets at a time. That's far too little to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other symptoms that may warn of a leak in the system. A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the selected period. They unplugged the sinks, tidied up and suggested a tool to be used in the future.</p>
