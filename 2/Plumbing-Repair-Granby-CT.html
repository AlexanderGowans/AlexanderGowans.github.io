<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to offer some type of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's wise to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the system.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can acquire models with unique features that do everything but add the salt, you will spend for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the unique function will not fail. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
