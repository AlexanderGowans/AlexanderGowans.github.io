<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Flint TX</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these issues.</p>
