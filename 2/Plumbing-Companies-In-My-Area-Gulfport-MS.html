<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If permitted to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
