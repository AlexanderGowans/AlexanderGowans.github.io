<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
