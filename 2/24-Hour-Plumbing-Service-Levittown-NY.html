I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
