<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in LincolnUniversity PA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
