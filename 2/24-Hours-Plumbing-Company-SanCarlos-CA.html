<p>Water heaters are checked for any signs of leaks, corrosion, or damage. If appropriate, all gas lines need to be inspected as well.

We'll drain and flush it to keep it running at peak efficiency if the water heater has a drain valve. Draining pipes a water heater extend its life.</p>
<p>Call 831-393-9321 for reliable and fast water heater solutions. Experience real quality service when you deal with our Beach plumbers. If your disposal is clogged, don't utilize severe drain cleaning chemicals to attempt to unclog the unit. Chemicals can harm the mechanical parts, reducing the life of the disposal.

While other things may be to blame, call a plumbing company immediately if you notice any of the following problems.</p>
