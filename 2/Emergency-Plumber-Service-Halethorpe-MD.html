<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Halethorpe MD</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
