<p>Water hardness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
<p>The system has gone back to an absolutely no need condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris in between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is avoiding the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way. This allows pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
