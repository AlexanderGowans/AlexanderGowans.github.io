<p>Release piping linked to a storm sewer will be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or damp lawn sprinkler unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
