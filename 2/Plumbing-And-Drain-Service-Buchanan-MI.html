<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally discharge small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
