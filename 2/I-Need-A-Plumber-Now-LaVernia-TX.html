Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.)

If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
