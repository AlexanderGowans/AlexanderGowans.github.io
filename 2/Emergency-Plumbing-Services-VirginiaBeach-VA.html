<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup VirginiaBeach VA</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
