After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to guarantee the line is effectively flushed.</p>
