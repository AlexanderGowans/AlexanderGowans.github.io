<p>Due to the fact that the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to end up being coated inside, New homes built with copper pipes are especially prone to corrosive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of three to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new homes are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does occur regularly than you believe! Frequently it occurs during the night when you don't see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
