For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of deterioration control.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
