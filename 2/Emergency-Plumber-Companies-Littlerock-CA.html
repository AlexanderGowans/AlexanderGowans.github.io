<p>Deterioration is a complicated phenomenon and there are many factors that speed up rust in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of rust control.
