<h3>Need A Plumber Service Lula GA</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the residential or commercial property or condominium board. Owners and boards of structures that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to file plans with the DEP within one month. If the DEP has not received certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the procedure of being installed within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent. Violators will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately cause civil and criminal actions and procedures, along with the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
