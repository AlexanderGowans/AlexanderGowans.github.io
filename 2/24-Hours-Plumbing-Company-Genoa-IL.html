<p>Everyday use need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a stable and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
