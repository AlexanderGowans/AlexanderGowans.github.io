<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
