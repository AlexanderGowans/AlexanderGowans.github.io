<p>A lot of plumbers will remove the old system to install the new one at the very same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the new unit, for that reason increasing costs. This actually depends on what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how tough the old system is to remove. In most cases, elimination will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, however in some cases the expenses might be greater if additional pipes need to also be replaced.</p>
<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time related. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and therefore the total expenses.

Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
