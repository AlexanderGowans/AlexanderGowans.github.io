<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
