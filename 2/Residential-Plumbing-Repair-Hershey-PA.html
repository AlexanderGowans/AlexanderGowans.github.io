<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
