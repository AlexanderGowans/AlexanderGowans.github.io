<p>There are a couple of indicators that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your house, and it is necessary to pay attention to them. The gas pipe might be pierced or harmed if you see a strong smell that looks like rotten eggs. You may also hear a hissing noise as the gas is escaping from the line, but that isn't constantly the case. It is crucial to take action rapidly to avoid any major problems and to keep everybody safe if you smell rotten eggs.</p>
<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper performance, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps remove the sediment. If you find a leak and opt for a patching job rather of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same product and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire home when you identify a leak.</p>
