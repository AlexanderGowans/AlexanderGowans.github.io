<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some disposer systems do not featured a power cord connected. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to purchase a circuitry kit with the proper power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Guarantee the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord when you link the wiring harness to the disposer.</p>

There may likewise be a concern with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
