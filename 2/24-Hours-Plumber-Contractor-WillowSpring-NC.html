<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet WillowSpring NC</h3>
<p>Contact your local licensed RainSoft dealership today to find out more about the advantages of acquiring a water softening system for your home. In addition to our EC4 model, you can also ask about our TC series water softeners, which provide similarly exceptional water softening benefits without the automated microprocessor controls of the EC4 system.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
