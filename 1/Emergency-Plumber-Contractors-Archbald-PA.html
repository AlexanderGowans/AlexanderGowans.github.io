<h3>Leak Detection Services: Leave It to the Archbald PA Experts</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. A number of homes in my area being repiped and have spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't detected quickly, apparently it starts with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger significant damage.</p>
