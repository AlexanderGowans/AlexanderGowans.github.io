<p>Place the flange on the top of the sink, and connect the attachment system on the underside (Image 1). It is handy to apply pressure on the flange from above using a second set of hands or a heavy item. This will keep the flange in place while attaching the fastening system below. Make certain the plumber's putty is noticeably exuding beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). Get rid of the excess putty with a rag once a total seal has formed.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
