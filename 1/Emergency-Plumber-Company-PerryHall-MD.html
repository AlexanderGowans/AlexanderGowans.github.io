<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
