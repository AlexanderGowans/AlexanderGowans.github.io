<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Clemmons North Carolina</h2>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
