Demand-initiated softeners are more efficient and popular than time-initiated softeners.</p>

<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and rust. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
