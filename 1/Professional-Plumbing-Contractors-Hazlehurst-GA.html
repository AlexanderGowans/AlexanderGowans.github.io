<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Hazlehurst GA?</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
