<p>Backflow preventers need to only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has degraded in its performance listed below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow.
