<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself.
