<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Dixon IL</h3>

A strategy might be essential to get the license if new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
