That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your home, launches sewer gas, and manages air pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be changed rather than repaired. You'll know this if your pipes are gurgling or releasing nasty odors.</p>
