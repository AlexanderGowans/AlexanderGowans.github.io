<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - primarily with sinks. For the most part, a sink drain problem is brought on by extreme contaminants or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps. While there are a number of chemical drain cleaning options, in some cases this can cause more damage than aid. Anytime you find a clogged drain, reach out to Resurrection Plumbing to identify the concern and advise the best repairs.</p>
<p>While lots of hot water heater problems can be successfully repaired, some problems will necessitate total water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its normal life expectancy (normally anywhere from 8 to 10 years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a significant leak or comprehensive rust, it may be time to think about replacement.</p>

If you have a newer system, an easy repair or replacing specific parts might be all that's required to get your hot water heater working again. In time tree roots can squash drains. Jenni Plumber has a Full Color Camera Inspection to totally inspect your drain and find the source of your sewer drain clog.
