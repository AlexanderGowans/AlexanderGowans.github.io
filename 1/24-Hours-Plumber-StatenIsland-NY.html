<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
