Place the plunger securely over the drain and plunge vigorously a number of times. Remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is normal in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
