<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
