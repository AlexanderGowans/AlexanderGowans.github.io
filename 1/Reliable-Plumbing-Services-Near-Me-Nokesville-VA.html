<p>Even if you think you can handle it on your own, you most likely do not have a camera appropriate for identifying the reason for blockage around bends in your pipes. You may even have a drain snake convenient, but when's the last time you used it-- and are you sure you're doing it right?

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
