<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

In either case, scalding water threatens and must be instantly resolved by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
