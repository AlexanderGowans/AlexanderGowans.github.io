<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
