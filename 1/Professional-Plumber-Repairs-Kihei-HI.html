<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe water system system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be correctly maintained. The salt water option should be combined and saved in the salt water tank. Periodic blocking of the resin also requires special attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will fix this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Similarly, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems. However, check out the manufacturer's guidelines before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
