A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>The most common concern with faucets is the leak and drip Not just can this take place in any location with a faucet such as cooking areas, bathrooms, and more - however it can be a progressive concern that ends up being a major issue. The issue with any leak or drip with a faucet is recognizing the root source.

After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed correctly, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
