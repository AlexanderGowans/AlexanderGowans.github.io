No matter what type of hot water heater you have or are interested in, the experts at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our water heater installation services. For instance, if your kitchen sink is backed up due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can separate the clog and send it down the pipes. We suggest you opt for drain snaking rather of using strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners may do more damage than good by rusting your pipes.</p>
