<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
