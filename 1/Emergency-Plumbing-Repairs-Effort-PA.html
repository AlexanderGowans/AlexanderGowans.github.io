<p>When pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the drinkable system providing the make-up water, backpressure is developed. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential impurities can then get in the potable water supply. The best method to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET used by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
