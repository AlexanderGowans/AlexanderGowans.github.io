<p>Does it seem like your drains are always sluggish or clogged? Typically, this is brought on by built-up sediment and other materials that are causing a blockage in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will try to charge you a leg and an arm to collect and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station provides hydro jetting, an extremely efficient solution for dislodging persistent products that have adhered to the walls of your pipeline, restoring a healthy flow to your drains.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up effectively, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
