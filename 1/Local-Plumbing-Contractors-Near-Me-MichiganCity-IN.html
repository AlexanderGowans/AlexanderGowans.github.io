<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>During regular operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the exterior if either check valve need to leak. An RPZ will periodically release small amounts of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be installed in areas that are exempt to water damage and enable appropriate drainage.</p>
