I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
