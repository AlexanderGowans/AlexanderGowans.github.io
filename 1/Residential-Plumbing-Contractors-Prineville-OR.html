<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
