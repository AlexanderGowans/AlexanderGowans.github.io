<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
