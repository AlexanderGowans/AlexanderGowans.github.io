<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
