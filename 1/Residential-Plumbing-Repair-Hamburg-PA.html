When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
