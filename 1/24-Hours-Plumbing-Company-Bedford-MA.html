<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed versus it will result in decapitation, it might frighten a couple of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
