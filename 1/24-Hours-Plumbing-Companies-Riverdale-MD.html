<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Riverdale MD</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these concerns.</p>
