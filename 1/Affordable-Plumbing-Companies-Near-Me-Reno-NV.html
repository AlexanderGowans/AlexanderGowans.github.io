<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
