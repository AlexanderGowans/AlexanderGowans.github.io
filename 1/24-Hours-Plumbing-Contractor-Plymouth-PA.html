<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>

<p>Your company has actually been extremely helpful to me for some time. The boy who came a few days back was so honest with me. I was prepared to spend a minimum of $500 for a warm water system and he said it wasn't necessary!!!! He could have set up the system and I 'd never have understood the difference. That's a quality organisation. . Installing a garbage disposal is a reasonably simple job for a skilled do-it-yourselfer. Grab a few basic tools and follow our how-to.</p>
