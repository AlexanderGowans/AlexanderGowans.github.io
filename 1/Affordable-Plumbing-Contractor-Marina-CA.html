<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
