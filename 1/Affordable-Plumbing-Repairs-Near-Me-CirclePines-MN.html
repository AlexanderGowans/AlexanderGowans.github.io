<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
