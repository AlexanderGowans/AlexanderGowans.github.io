<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
