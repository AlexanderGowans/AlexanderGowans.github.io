I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
