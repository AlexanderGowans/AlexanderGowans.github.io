<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Newtonville MA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
