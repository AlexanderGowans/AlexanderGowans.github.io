<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood.
