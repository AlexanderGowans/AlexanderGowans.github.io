<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
