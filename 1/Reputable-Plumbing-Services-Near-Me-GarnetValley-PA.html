<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
