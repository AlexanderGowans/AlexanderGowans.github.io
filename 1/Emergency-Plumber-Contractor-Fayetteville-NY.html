<h3>Plumbing Services Around Fayetteville NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>
