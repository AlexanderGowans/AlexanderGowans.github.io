How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Prior to you can ask for an inspection, you should first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you plan to do.

<p>Most toilets utilized today operate with a standard gravity flushing design, meaning they utilize the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system.

This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing system to suck the water into the bowl and down into the drains. A disadvantage of this device is that it's a lot more challenging to unclog your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
