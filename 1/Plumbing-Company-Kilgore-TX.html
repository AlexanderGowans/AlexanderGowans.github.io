<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

Even if you take excellent care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, often blockages are unavoidable. If you have a clogged drain, it is extremely essential that you do not attempt to unclog it yourself due to the fact that this might potentially result in a large leak and more costly repairs.</p>
