<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening simply eliminates hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
