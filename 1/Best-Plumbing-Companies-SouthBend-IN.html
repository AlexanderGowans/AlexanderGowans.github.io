<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in SouthBend IN</h3>
<p>Obvious odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your home or service area, offer us a call. That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and manages air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will typically need to be changed instead of repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or emitting nasty odors, you'll know this.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Most of the times, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is used to unclog the pipe and remove the particles. Depending on the intensity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog is located, a high powered auger may be needed. Parker & Sons Plumbing values the safety and security of all of our customers, so our plumbers are all highly-trained and guaranteed to ensure you get safe and quality service. Give Parker & Sons Plumbing a call if you need skilled gas line services in San Antonio and the surrounding areas.</p>
