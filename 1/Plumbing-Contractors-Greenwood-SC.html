<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on wet or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
<p>This veteran Oregon plumbing organisation looks after both commercial and residential plumbing repairs. P-trap. If the P-trap under you sink is clogged, it can cause water to develop all the way up your drains and develop a leak someplace along the way. If you are irritated by your 'always foggy' glass wares; dull and dull laundry; rough hair and skin; and spotty tubs, sinks and toilets, call 2 Sons Plumbing today for installing a water softener.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
