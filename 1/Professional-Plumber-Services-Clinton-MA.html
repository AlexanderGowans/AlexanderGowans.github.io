<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the normal instructions from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need.

Broken Pipes: Pipes are split, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling.
