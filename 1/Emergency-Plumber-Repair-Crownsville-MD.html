The brine option should be mixed and stored in the salt water tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin also requires special attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, typical backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to assist separate the material. Similarly, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
