<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
