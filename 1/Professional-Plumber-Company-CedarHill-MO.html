<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
