<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Bladensburg MD</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, an unique type of black pipe should be used that is covered with a special plastic material that keeps the moisture out. This is so it is quickly noticeable from underground water lines, and also since the plastic covering in fact safeguards the pipe much better than a galvanized coating would.</p>
