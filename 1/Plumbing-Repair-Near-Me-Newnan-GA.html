<p>For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines. Although an EcoWater dealership does not support your area currently, we enjoy to assist you with an alternative service. You can buy, with totally free shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services below can then assist with installation, or you can simply install the system yourself.</p>
<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the normal direction from the supplier, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Decreased Pressure. This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the normal instructions.</p>
