<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
