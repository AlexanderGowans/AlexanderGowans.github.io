<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
