I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
