<p>106.2.1 Fixing Leakages. The stopping of leakages in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe, offered that if any hidden trap, drain, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes malfunctioning and it ends up being needed to get rid of and replace the very same with new material, such work will be thought about as brand-new work and a permit shall be acquired and an inspection made as supplied in this Code, subject to the arrangements stated in Area 106.2.2.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
