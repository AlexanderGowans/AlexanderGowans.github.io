Toilet continues to run - Either fill device has failed to shutoff or runs out modification sending out water into the bowl. Toilet flapper is broken and no longer sealing water from getting in bowl.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

Sometimes it might be essential to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin ends up being fouled. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
