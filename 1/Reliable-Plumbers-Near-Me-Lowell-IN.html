<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of reasons, consisting of bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and grime, and rust.

<p>Backflow preventers need to just be repaired when the data gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer.

These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
