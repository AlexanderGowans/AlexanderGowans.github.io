<p>Water softeners are appliances linked to your home's water supply that eliminate the minerals like calcium and magnesium that trigger water hardness. Water softening equipment can be quickly gotten rid of, so you can take it with you if you move.

<p>While UPC does differentiate between residential and commercial systems, its leniency only uses to residential systems using drinkable water piping materials. In one- and two-family residences, AWWA mentions that backflow preventers are not needed on lawn sprinkler built of approved safe and clean product and developed to flow water, so it does not stagnate. Instead, backflow requirements for domestic plumbing could use to those lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>
