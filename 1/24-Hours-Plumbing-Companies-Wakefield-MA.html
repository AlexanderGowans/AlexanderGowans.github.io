<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, readily available in a single-tank "cabinet" style. It is extremely advised for either municipal or well water supplies. Nobody wants to walk into a kitchen or a bathroom and discover a sink loaded with black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be functioning correctly in order to maintain sanitary and safe living conditions as well.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be personalized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to determine the ideal water treatment for your home. A single tank or cabinet-style system needs less area since the softener's salt water tank nests within the salt tank.
