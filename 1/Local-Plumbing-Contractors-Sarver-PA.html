<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
