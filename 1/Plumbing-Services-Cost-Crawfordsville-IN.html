<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Crawfordsville IN</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
