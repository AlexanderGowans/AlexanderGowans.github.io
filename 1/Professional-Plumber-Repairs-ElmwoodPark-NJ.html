<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies ElmwoodPark NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
