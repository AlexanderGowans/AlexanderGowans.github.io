<p>Providing quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions likewise allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, you may have a farmhouse or apron sink, a bar sink, an undermount sink, or a cast iron sink, maybe with an enamel plating. Double-basin stainless steel sinks are a timeless and popular choice, as are bar sinks, kitchen island sinks, and sinks with drain boards. No matter what kind of sink you need serviced, Candu can help you find a local plumber to fix, install, or replace it.</p>

We will not stop up until your drain is clear and totally free of dirt, grease, and debris. We likewise use hydrojetting to clear out those truly difficult obstructions.</p>
<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished salt water solution after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hose pipes must have an air gap. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air gap might be used to accomplish this, and may be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
