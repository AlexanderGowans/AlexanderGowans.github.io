<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
