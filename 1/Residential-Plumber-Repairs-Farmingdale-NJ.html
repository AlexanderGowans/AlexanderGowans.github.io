<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
