<p>Electric water heaters do have a few downsides however that are worth explaining. Most importantly, electrical energy is not as low-cost as gas. Some utility companies charge greater rates for electrical energy throughout peak periods such as very early in the morning and in the evening. Utilizing your heater during these peak durations can increase your power costs. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a fixed rate. Another downside of an electrical water heater is that they can be pricey to install, particularly when it comes to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or excessive food being disposed down the drain.

Offer us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is slow to drain.</p>
