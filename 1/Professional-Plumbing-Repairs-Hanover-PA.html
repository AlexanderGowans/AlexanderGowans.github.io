<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
<p>Leaks can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Because the tank or the entire toilet should be lifted off the floor for a proper repair, either of these leaks can be challenging to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a much more pricey repair. Ryan's Plumbing has actually carefully trained personnel who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>

Piping must be at least 18 inches below ground for much safer areas and 24 inches for locations at greater risk of external damage.</p>
