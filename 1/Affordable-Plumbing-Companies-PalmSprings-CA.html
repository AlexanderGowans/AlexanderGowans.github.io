<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to obtain a plumbing permit prior to replacing a backflow or setting up preventer. Supplied there isn't a tank failure, normally a commercial water heater can be repaired, however is it worth repairing? Just after addressing the following questions must you address repair or replace. Do you know how many years old your hot water heater is? Do you know how many years it's ranked for? If it is close to the variety of years the water heater was rated for, think about replacement rather of repair.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Picture 1. If extra pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running sound, water is likely escaping through a split or corroded overflow tube.
