However, the high-energy cost savings will more than recoup this expenditure over the next couple of years. To get your garbage disposal working again, you will first want to use a flashlight to check for foreign objects lodged in the drum's openings. You can remove it safely with needle-nose pliers if you observe a blockage.</p>

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>You can go ahead and totally tighten up the slip joints with your pliers when everything looks like it's going to fit together. Protect the dishwasher's drain hose to the inlet on the disposer if linking a dishwasher to the disposer. This ion exchange procedure is facilitated by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. Install the backflow preventer. Make sure to install it according to our specs We advise employing a professional installer. Offer the installer with a copy of the letter and accompanying info.</p>
