<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
