For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
