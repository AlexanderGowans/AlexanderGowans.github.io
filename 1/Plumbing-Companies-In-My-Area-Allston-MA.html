<h3>Water Softeners & Filters in Allston Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the task was done to my total fulfillment.</p>
