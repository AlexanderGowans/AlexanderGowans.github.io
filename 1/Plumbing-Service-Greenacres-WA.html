<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller sized model that ran on the same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>Porcelain and stainless steel sinks can last anywhere from 15 to thirty years, with porcelain sinks long lasting thirty years or longer. Porcelain sinks with cast-iron cores can last the longest, and many porcelain sinks can be refinished numerous times. Yes, certified and licensed plumbers can make installation and repair changes to the gas piping system.</p>
