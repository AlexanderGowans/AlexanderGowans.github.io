<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not wish to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>As mentioned, clogged or blocked drains and pipes can cause damage to your house. Not only can dirty pipes cause your water to drain gradually, however it can also cause pipes to burst and septic system back-ups. Ensure you don't have a plumbing catastrophe and ensure your pipes are clean. 1. Get rid of the garbage disposer and disconnect all the old traps and drain lines from beneath the sink.</p>
