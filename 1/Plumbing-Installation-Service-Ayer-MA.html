<p>When choosing the correct system security there are numerous factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be taken a look at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to fulfill that specific threat or need. An aircraft hangar will need an extremely different fire security system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also differ considerably.</p>
