<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, use or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed.

A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with effectively adjusted gauge equipment.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
