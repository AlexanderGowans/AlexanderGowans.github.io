<h3>Shower Valve Repair in LaGrange Illinois</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink.

Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain. By including perseverence and persistence the task was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
