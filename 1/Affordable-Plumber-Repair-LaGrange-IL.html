<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink.

With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain. By including perseverence and persistence the task was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
