<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
