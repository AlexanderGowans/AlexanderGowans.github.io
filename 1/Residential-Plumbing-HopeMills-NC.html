Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time in between charging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to get rid of firmness.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers must be checked every year and after repair, moving, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT). A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. The majority of the tankless heaters included a manufacturer service warranty ranging from 10 to 15 years. These heaters normally last more than twenty years.</p>
