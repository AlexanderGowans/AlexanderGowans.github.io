<p>Because of an issue at the point of installation or because of maintenance, water softeners leaks are mostly caused. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately.

A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth processes. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely broken and merely needs to be replaced.</p>
