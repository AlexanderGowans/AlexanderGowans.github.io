<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does take place regularly than you believe! Typically it happens in the evening when you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
