Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>

<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>5. Pour warm water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have actually made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you shouldn't have, a clogged toilet is never an enjoyable experience. Fortunately, you do not always need the support of a professional to fix it.</p>
