I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
