<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Whiteville NC</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by hanging on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water goes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Since the hardness minerals have a higher favorable charge than the salt, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
