<p>As an ESSENTIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, we remain Offered and open to assist with any of your plumbing, drain, heating, cooling or electrical requirements. The waste disposal unit is one of the most misused home appliances in the whole home. Few homeowners realize that a disposal is designed particularly to deal with food residue rinsed from a plate-- not entire chunks of leftovers! Large amounts of food can quickly overwhelm the system and trigger a substantial clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives so many telephone call asking for waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are harmless, but in time they build up and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
