<p>Pointer: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and examine the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you see water reappearing in your sink or shower?

<p>Drain pipe is not protected utilizing the required solvent cement (end of the pipe ought to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe.

<p>You live in an older house. There's a good opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes.
