Larry & Sons uses comprehensive sewer line and drain installation for basic drainage in municipal water products, septic systems for those not linked to a city sewer system, and drain tile systems for basement water elimination Our specialist specialists carefully install brand-new drainage pipes and systems, and hand select elements that match your system's particular requirements.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>A lot of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
