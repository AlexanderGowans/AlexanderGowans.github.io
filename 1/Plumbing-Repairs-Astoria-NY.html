Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
