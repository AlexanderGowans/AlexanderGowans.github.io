<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If permitted to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
