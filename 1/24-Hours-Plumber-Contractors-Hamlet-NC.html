<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Hamlet NC</h3>
<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Fixing a gas line is really changing a gas line - if it's faulty it needs to be replaced. The cost of gas line replacement is determined by the cost of labor and products. The variance of the cost depends on whether the task is a simple gas leak repair or a complete replacement of the gas line system. Extra gas line installation for new appliances are charged separately.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to consider the age of your unit. If your system is getting near to 10 years old, it's usually not a good idea to spend for repairs if they deserve more than 50 percent of the rate of a brand-new unit.
