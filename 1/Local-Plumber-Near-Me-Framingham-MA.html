The relief valve is created to release and open water to the outside if either check valve should leak. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
