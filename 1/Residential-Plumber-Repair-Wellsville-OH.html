<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Wellsville OH</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A water conditioner, on the other hand, handles tough water problems in a more ingenious way. It can change the way minerals behave while dissolved in the water. While the minerals are still present for any health advantages, they do not build up on surfaces and in plumbing fixtures. Keeping the minerals in the water is a good idea, as long as you can stop the destructive adverse effects.</p>
