<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health danger conditions. They should be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just protect versus back siphonage.</p>
