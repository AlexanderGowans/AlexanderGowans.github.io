<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.

<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building regulations for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any potential siphon before it can take place, avoiding infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complicated and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow variety from the reasonably basic to the extremely sophisticated and complex.</p>
