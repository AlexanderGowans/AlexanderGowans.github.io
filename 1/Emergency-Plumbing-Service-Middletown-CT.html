Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
