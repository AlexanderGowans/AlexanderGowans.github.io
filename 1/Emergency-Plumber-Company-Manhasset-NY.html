<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain effectively or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Often drain repair needs can be fixed fairly rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain may need to be disassembled, taken a look at, and cleared before being replaced. Sometimes, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is needed (like a tailpiece, reducer, or PVC  trap) to guarantee regular operation for your drain.
