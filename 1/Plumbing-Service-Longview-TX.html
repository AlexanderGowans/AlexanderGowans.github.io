<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up properly, you might experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
