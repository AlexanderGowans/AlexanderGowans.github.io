<p>The next step we should perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed elements are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
