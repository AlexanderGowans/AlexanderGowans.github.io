<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe supply of water system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The salt water solution should be combined and stored in the salt water tank. Regular clogging of the resin also requires unique attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, regular backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Also, fungis and bacteria likewise form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. However, check out the manufacturer's directions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>

<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water main. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
