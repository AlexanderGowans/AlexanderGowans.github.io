<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
