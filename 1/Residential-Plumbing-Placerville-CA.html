<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
