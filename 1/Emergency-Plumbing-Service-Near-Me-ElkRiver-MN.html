<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating ElkRiver MN</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
