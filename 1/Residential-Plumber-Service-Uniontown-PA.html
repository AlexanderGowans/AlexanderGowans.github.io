<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were really responsive and timely to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did an incredible task. I would definitely call them again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration just appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes.
