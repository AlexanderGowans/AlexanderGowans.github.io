<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health hazard if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
