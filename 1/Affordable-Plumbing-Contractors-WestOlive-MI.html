<p>A lot of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Throughout water, installation and electrical energy are shut off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are eliminated and cleaned of any putty. Loosen up the nuts that link the drain pipe, consisting of the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Use your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections. Place a bucket below the drain pipe to catch any water that leakages out.</p>
