If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was built decades prior to that, possibilities are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>
