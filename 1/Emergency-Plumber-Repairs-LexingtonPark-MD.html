<p>After getting here after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they would not take duty if it dripped now since of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company again.</p>
