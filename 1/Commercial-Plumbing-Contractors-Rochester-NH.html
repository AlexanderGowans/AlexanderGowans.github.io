<p>To avoid these things from obstructing your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons advises that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These clever additions to your tubs and sinks can lower the amount of hair and food scraps that end up in your drainpipes. Many garbage disposals will require a new sink drain flange, which consists of the metal disk at the drain entrance at the bottom of the sink along with a short length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>Utilize the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of houses in my area being repiped and have actually spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't detected quickly.</p>
