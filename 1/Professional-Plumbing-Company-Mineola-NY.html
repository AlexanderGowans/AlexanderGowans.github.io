<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Mineola NY</h3>
<p>We all know that plumbing in any house or residence will develop blockages. It takes place to everyone. Many stopped-up sinks and plugged toilets can be fixed quickly. You can count on the professionals from Courtesy Plumbing Inc But does every WaterPro customer need to install a backflow prevention device? The answer is: you need backflow prevention if you have a cooking water connection that may be used to provide a sprinkler system.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
