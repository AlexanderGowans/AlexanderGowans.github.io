<p>Brief response: If you have momentary water firmness, yes you can. When you deal with Time Plumbing, Heating & Electric Inc. you are treated to the individual attention you are worthy of.

<p>She learnt about the service call fee. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation found that's a common charge. Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get an estimate from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a quote over the phone. All of them wished to look at the circumstance before committing to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
