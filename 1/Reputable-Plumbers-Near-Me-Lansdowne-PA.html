<p>The Bureau of Plumbing and Gasfitting Inspections is a department of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections and is responsible for examining work carried out by licensed plumbers and gasfitters to guarantee conformity with the plumbing and gas code. Expense 41-15 (PDF): The Current Plumbing and Gasfitting Code of Baltimore County was approved by the County Council on May 4, 2015 with an effective date of July 1, 2015.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally two layers of protection. The device enables water to press the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way. There are two various kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a minimized pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. I mention them only due to the fact that they will be on a certification test.</p>
