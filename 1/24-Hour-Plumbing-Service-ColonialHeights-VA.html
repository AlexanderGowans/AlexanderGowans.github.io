Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>By replacing the worn away and rusted galvanized metal pipe with new copper pipes, your house will have cleaner and better-tasting water.
