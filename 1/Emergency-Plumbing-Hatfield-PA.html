This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing expenses.

Oftentimes, removal will only include an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, however in some cases the costs might be greater if extra pipes must also be replaced.</p>

<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as detailed below. Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket might lead to percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
