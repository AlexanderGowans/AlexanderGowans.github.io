<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe must be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not really glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
