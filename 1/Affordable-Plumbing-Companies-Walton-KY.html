<p>Read your insurance policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually failed. Make sure you know what is covered and what is not covered. Numerous insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be rejected because the basic HO-3 property owners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended amount of time." Call your insurance agent and verify your coverage. Double check with your representative to validate that your understanding is appropriate when you have read through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a home is because there is excessive hair in the shower drain.
