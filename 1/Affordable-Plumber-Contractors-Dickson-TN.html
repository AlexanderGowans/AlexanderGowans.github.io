<p>Without a building permit, your home owner's insurance may deny a claim for damage triggered by a failed hot water heater. Health and life loss aren't the only adverse effects of a leaking gas pipeline; monetary loss is just as damaging.

Place a container below the drain pipe to capture any water that leakages out.</p>
