<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in NewHydePark NY?</h3>

For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate rust Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of deterioration control. Therefore, considering all these aspects, along with arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
