We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water spots and corrosion. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
