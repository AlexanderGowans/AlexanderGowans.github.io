<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Louisville CO</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
