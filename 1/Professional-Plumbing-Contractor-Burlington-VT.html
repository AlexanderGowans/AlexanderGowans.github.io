<p>Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
