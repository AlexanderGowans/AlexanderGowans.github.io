<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
