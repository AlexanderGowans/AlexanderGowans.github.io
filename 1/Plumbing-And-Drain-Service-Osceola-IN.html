<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).
