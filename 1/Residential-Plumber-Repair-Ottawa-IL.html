<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
