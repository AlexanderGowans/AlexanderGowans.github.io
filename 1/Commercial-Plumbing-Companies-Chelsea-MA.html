<p>Noise is typical, but when you see that the noises are all there but food is not being ground up it is likely that the motor has gone.

Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) presses against the # 1 check and likewise fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pushing it closed.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
