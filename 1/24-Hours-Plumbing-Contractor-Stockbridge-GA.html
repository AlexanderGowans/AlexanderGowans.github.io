<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Stockbridge GA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its lots of desired uses around your house.</p>
