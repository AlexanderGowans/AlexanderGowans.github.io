<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is extremely little insulation in the weaker models. Here are some typical types of waste disposal unit you might wish to consider. There are usually two types of disposals: aluminum and stainless steel. Aluminum disposals are the most cost-effective, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are prone to rust and leaking.</p>

In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>It can quickly end up being a plumbing emergency for your home if a clogged drain is left untreated. At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Cooling we provide 24-hour emergency assistance for circumstances like burst pipes triggered by obstructions. Detach the waste disposal unit, if you're saving it. How the disposal is linked to the sink varies based upon brand name and type. Refer to your item guidelines or get in touch with the manufacturer if you need assistance. The disposal will generally be linked to the drain line with either a screw or a nut.</p>
