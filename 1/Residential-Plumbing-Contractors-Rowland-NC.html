It's prevalent for a toilet to have actually broken parts at some time which triggers the toilet to run.

<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.</p>
