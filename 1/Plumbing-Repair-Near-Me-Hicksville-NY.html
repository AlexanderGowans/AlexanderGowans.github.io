<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Hicksville NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

Make certain that the softener is filled with salt or potassium chloride following the maker's recommendations.</p>
