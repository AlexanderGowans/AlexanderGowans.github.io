<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>

Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
