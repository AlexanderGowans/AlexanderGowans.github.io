I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
