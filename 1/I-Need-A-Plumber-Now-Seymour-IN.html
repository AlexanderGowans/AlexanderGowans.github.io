You'll need to produce a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger. Place the plunger strongly over the drain and plunge strongly a number of times. Remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water when you hear the suction clear the clog.</p>

<p>IRWD is devoted to delivering safe, high quality water to clients. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our customers is kept free from harmful pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the potable water supply. This can take place through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
