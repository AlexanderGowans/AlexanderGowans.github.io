<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and disastrous water problems: tough water.  Hard water wreaks havoc on the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the life expectancy of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice makers. Difficult water damages warm water appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
