<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, broken pipe out while changing it with a new one at the very same time. We did a follow-up call to the homeowner a number of weeks later on, and she reported no excess water in her backyard. Task well done: You don't want to end up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a certified plumber ensures a smooth installation procedure.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the make-up water, backpressure is created. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Prospective pollutants can then enter the safe and clean water system. The best method to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
