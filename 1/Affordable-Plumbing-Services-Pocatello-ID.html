<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in locations where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>Getting Blocked Sewer Drainage Solutions in Pocatello ID</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be continually monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
