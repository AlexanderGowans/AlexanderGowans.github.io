<p>You reside in an older home. There's an excellent possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old.

This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
