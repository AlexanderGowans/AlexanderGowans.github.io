After we have cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>

Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water function or other kind of cross connection, have actually an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
