I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
