<p>Most plumbers will eliminate the old unit to install the new one at the very same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This really depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old unit is to eliminate. Oftentimes, removal will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the total costs, but sometimes the costs might be higher if additional pipes need to also be replaced.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
