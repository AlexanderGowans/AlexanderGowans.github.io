Some disposer systems do not featured a power cord attached. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to acquire a circuitry kit with the correct power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you link the circuitry harness to the disposer, ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable.</p>
