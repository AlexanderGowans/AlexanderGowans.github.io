<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In MontgomeryVillage MD</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
