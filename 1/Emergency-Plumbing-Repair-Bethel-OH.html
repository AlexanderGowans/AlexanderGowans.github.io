<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in different parts of the plumbing system, a lot of frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow problems or even stop a component from streaming altogether. The next common concern that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it decreases the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water coming from your water appliances? This is a great indicator that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be changed. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water only features warm water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
