When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, in addition to examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
