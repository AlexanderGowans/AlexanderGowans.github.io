<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
