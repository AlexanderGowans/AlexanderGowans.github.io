<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
