A water softener addresses one of the most destructive and widespread water problems: tough water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern-day home. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the lifespan of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices.
