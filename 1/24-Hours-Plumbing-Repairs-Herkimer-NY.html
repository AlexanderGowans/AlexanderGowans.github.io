<h3>Leak Detection Services: Leave It to the Herkimer NY Experts</h3>
<p>When your water heater begins to leak, you need to replace it quick. We'll show you how to install your own gas hot water heater in less than a day.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

I would fix a limit at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired hot water heater (and some other specialized models). Their installation must be handled by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
