<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
