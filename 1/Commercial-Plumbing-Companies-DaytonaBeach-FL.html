<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't set up properly, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
