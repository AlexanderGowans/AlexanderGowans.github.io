<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Burbank CA</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
