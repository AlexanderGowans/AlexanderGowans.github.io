<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll see that water goes to refill the bowl. Nevertheless, in an effectively working toilet, the water needs to stop running when the bowl is filled to its proper capacity. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being dumped down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leakages are incredibly inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up traveling through the overflow.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
