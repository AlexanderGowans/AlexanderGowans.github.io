<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now.

You can have a look at our License page for additional information on acquiring a license. Once you get a license you can start with the work.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
