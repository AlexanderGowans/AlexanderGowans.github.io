<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
