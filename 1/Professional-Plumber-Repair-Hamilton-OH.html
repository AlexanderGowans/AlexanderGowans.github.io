<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>There are several indications to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all appliances and fixtures in your house have actually been shut off. 3) The hot water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to greater gas and water expenses, in some cases extremely rapidly.</p>
