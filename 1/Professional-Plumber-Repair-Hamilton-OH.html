<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
